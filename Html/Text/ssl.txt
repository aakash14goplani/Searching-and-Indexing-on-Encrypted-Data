The security community’s perception of the “oblivious”
user evolved from the results of a number of laboratory
studies on browser security indicators [5, 11, 13, 15, 26,
30, 34]. However, these studies are not necessarily representative
of the current state of browser warnings in
2013. Most of the studies evaluated warnings that have
since been deprecated or significantly modified, often in
response to criticisms in the aforementioned studies. Our
goal is to investigate whether modern browser security
warnings protect users in practice.
We performed a large-scale field study of user decisions
after seeing browser security warnings. Our study
encompassed 25,405,944 warning impressions in Google
Chrome and Mozilla Firefox in May and June 2013. We
collected the data using the browsers’ telemetry frameworks,
which are a mechanism for browser vendors to
collect pseudonymous data from end users. Telemetry
allowed us to unobtrusively measure user behavior during
normal browsing activities. This design provides realism:
our data reflects users’ actual behavior when presented
with security warnings.
In this paper, we present the rates at which users click
through (i.e., bypass) malware, phishing, and SSL warnings.
Low clickthrough rates are desirable because they
indicate that users notice and heed the warnings. Clickthrough
rates for the two browsers’ malware and phishing
warnings ranged from 9% to 23%, and users clicked
through 33.0% of Mozilla Firefox’s SSL warnings. This
demonstrates that browser security warnings can effectively
protect most users in practice.
Unfortunately, users clicked through Google Chrome’s
SSL warning 70.2% of the time. This implies that the
user experience of a warning can have a significant impact
on user behavior. We discuss several factors that might
contribute to this warning’s higher clickthrough rates. Our
positive findings for the other five warnings suggest that
the clickthrough rate for Google Chrome’s SSL warning
can be improved.

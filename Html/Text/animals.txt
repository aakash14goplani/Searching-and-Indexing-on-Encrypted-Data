RIGHT FOR ANIMALS

Animal rights is the idea that some or all nonhuman animals are entitled to the possession of their own lives, and that their most basic interests – such as an interest in not suffering – should be afforded the same consideration as the similar interests of human beings. Advocates oppose the assignment of moral value and fundamental protections on the basis of species membership alone. They agree for the most part that animals should no longer be viewed as property, or used as food, clothing, research subjects, entertainment, or beasts of burden.
Critics of animals rights argue that animals are unable to enter into a social contract, and thus cannot be possessors of rights, a view summed up by the philosopher Roger Scruton, who writes that only humans have duties, and therefore only humans have rights.

ETHICS:

Animal rights teach us that certain things are wrong as a matter of principle, that there are some things that it is morally wrong to do to animals.Human beings must not do those things, no matter what the cost to humanity of not doing them.Human beings must not do those things, even if they do them in a humane way.
For example: if animals have a right not to be bred and killed for food then animals must not be bred and killed for food. It makes no difference if the animals are given 5-star treatment throughout their lives and then killed humanely without any fear or pain - it's just plain wrong in principle, and nothing can make it right.

The case for animal rights:
The case for animal rights is usually derived from the case for human rights.
•	Human animals have rights.
•	There is no morally relevant difference between human animals and adult mammals.
•	Therefore adult mammals must have rights too.
Human beings and adult mammals have rights because they are both 'subjects-of-a-life'.

The case against animal rights:
A number of arguments are put forward against the idea that animals have rights.
•	Animals don't think
•	Animals are not really conscious
•	Animals were put on earth to serve human beings
•	Animals don't have souls
•	Animals don't behave morally
•	Animals are not members of the 'moral community'
•	Animals lack the capacity for free moral judgment

ISSUES: :

Much of the current opposition to animal research is being fueled by a philosophical position known as “animal rights.” According to this viewpoint, animals have inherent legal and moral rights, just as humans do. This implies that it is unethical to use animals as pets or for any other purpose, whether for food, clothing, recreation, or research.
Whether or not animals have “rights” depends on how the term is defined. If living things are ascribed a “right” to remain living, then animals would have rights. But most ethicists do not use the term so broadly. They generally ascribe rights only to members of societies that are capable of applying mutually accepted ethical principles to specific situations.Animals are not capable of forming or belonging to such societies. In this light, they cannot be ascribed rights.
